### 1.4.6 Short Circuit Evaluation
***

```python
# Crash (as we'd expect)
print((1 == 2/0) and (3 == 4))

# Returns False. (this isnt good! It never checked the second statement.)
print((3 == 4) and (1 == 2/0))
```

This time, the code does not crash! Instead, it prints `False`. What happened?

This is an example of **short-circuit evaluation**. When Python evaluates an `and` operator, it stops (or short-circuits) as soon as it knows the answer. In the example above, Python evaluated `(3 == 4)`, which is `False`. So at that point, we had `False and (1 == 2/0)`. However, `False and otherValue` is `False` whether `otherValue` is `True` or `False`. Thus, when Python sees `False` as the first part of the `and`, it short-circuits to `False` without evaluating the second part.

##### This may seem obscure, but it is in fact very handy at times. For example, say you have this code:
***
```python
if score > 100:
    print('You win!')
```

This seems fine, but let's also assume that while the score is usually an integer, it can sometimes be the value `None`. In that case, if `score` is `None`, the example above will crash when it tries to test if `None > 100`.

Fortunately, we can avoid that crash by the following use of short-circuit evaluation:

```python
if (score != None) and (score > 100):
    print('You win!')
```

Now, if `score` is `None`, then `(score != None)` is `False`, so the `and` short-circuits to `False` without crashing.

### 1.4.7 Improper Use of Conditionals : Boolean things
***
See: # Using Boolean Values in Arithmetic.
#### Strings inside Boolean Operators: **`print('' or 'abc')`**

Here, we are using strings inside of an `or` operator. The result of this depends on two facts:

1. Python automatically converts non-Booleans to Boolean values inside Boolean operators (`and`, `or`, and `not`), and
2. Python treats `0`, `0.0`, `''` (the empty string), `None`, and similar "empty" or zero-like values as `False`, and all other values as `True`.

> [!call] “falsey” and “truthy”
> Values other than `False` that Python converts to `False` are sometimes called "falsey" values. Similarly, values other than `True` that Python converts to `True` are sometimes called "truthy" values. Thus, `''` is falsey and `'abc'` is truthy.


#### **`int(True) == 1`** and **`int(False) == 0`**

With that said, let's see this in action. Here is some typical code with a conditional:

```python
  score = 50
  if strength > 20:
      score += 10
```

The following code does the same thing, without the conditional:

```python
  score = 50
  score += int(strength > 20) * 10
```

Do you see what is happening? If `strength > 20` is `True`, then `int(strength > 20)` is `1`, and so the code adds `1 * 10`, or `10`. But if `int(strength > 20)` is `False`, then `int(strength > 20)` is `0`, and the code adds `0 * 10`, or `0`.

In fact, you can go further and omit the `int` call in the previous example, and it will still "work". That is, instead of this:

```python
  score = 50 + int(strength > 20) * 10
```

You can do this:

```python
  score = 50 + (strength > 20) * 10
```

Sadly, that still works. Why? Because when you use Booleans in arithmetic, Python automatically converts them to integers for you, converting `True` to `1`, and `False` to `0`.




### 1.2.6 Helpful Functions in Python
***
#### Use `rounded()` from `from cmu_cpcs_utilis import rounded` instead of `round()`

#### `math.isclose()` doesn’t work as expected for values near 0. Just use `almostEqual()`

```python
import math
from cmu_cpcs_utils import almostEqual

print(math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3))     # True, seems to work
print(math.isclose(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3, 0)) # False (oh no!)

# Verify this works with almostEqual:
print(almostEqual(0.1 + 0.2 - 0.3, 0))  # True (whew!)
```

#### `round()` ROUNDS TO THE NEAREST EVEN INT.

```python
round(1.5) # 2
round(2.5) # 2
```

#### `min() & max()` PRESERVE TYPE!
What is `min(2, 3.5)` and `max(2, 3.5)`? The answers are the int `2` and the float `3.5`.

#### `abs()` PRESERVES TYPE! → `abs(-12)` is NOT THE SAME as `abt(-12.0)`
Because `abs()` preserves the type. `abs(-12.0) == 12.0`.

#### `bool()` returns `False` for `0, 0.0,` and `''`. But `True` for non-zero numbers and non-empty strings.

#### `int()` ROUNDS DOWN.
`int(12.8) == 12`


### 1.2.1 Operators : Arithmetic Operators
> 06-01-2024  07:09

- `/` always returns a float, so `6 / 2` is the float `3.0` and not the int `3`.
- `//` is the integer division operator (sometimes called "div"). This performs standard division, but then rounds down (towards negative infinity). For positive values, this is the same as simply ignoring the part of the result after the decimal point. 
	- For example, since `11 / 4` is `2.75`, `11 // 4` is `2.75` rounded down, which is `2`. 
	- However, `-11 / 4` is `-2.75`, so rounded down, `-11 / 4` returns `-3`.
- We can use `x % 10` to get the ones digit of any integer `x`.
- We can use `x // 10` to basically remove the ones digit of any integer

#### We can also swap on a single line using **parallel assignment**, like so:
  ```python
  x = 2
  y = 3

# This successfully swaps using parallel assignment:
x, y = y, x

print(x) # 3
print(y) # 2
```
  UNDERSTAND THIS : In parallel assignment, **all the values on the right-hand side are computed before any of the variables on the left-hand side are assigned those values**. Thus, in the last example above, the right-hand side uses the old values of both `y` and `x` before it then assigns those values in order to `x` and `y`. Its like the left hand `x, y` are totally new variables, they just have the same name on the outside.

#### Order of Operations : EXPONENTIATION READS **RIGHT TO LEFT**

Within each level, evaluate from left-to-right (except *exponentiation*, which unfortunately goes *right-to-left*).

```python
#Evaluate this expression after 1 step of evaluation:
9 // 3 ** 2 ** 0
# Answer:
9 // 3 ** 1
# we do 2 ** 0 first.
```
1. Parentheses: `( )`
2. Exponentiation Operator: `**`
3. Multiplicative Operators: `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`
4. Additive Operators: `+`, `-`

#### Chained Assignment and Comparison Operators

```python
# Chained ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

# instead of this when you want to assign 2 vars to the same value...
x = 123 ** 45
y = x

# do this!
x = y = 123 ** 45

# Chained COMPARISON OPERATORS
# instead of 
((0 < i) and (i <= j))
# you can use
(0 < i <= j)
```

#### NEVER USE `==` WITH FLOATS. USE `almostEqual` FUNC TO COMPARE FLOATS.

```python
from cmu_cpcs_utils import almostEqual
print(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3)            # False
print(almostEqual(0.1 + 0.2, 0.3)) # True (whew!)
```

#### `math.isclose()` doesn’t work as expected for values near 0. Just use `almostEqual()`


#### Expressions vs. Statements
> link: [CMU CS Academy](https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/notes/5183#expressions vs statements)
```python
# This is an Expression : 
# variable = expression
x = 15 + 4
# 15 + 4 is the expression. Examples of expressions include literals (constants), variables, function calls, or any combination of these using operators and parentheses.


# This is a Statement : 
x = 15 + 4
# It's the whole thing! A statement is an action or a command, such as an assignment statement, or a conditional statement, or a function definition.A Python program consists of statements, and statements generally use expressions.
